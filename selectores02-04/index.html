                <p>
                    This document specifies a simple compressed file format for fonts, designed primarily for use on the Web and known as WOFF (Web Open Font Format). Despite this name, WOFF should be regarded as a container format or "wrapper" for font data in already-existing formats rather than an actual font format in its own right.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The WOFF format is a container for the table-based sfnt structure used in e.g. TrueType [TrueType], OpenType [OpenType] and Open Font Format [OFF] fonts, hereafter referred to as sfnt fonts. A WOFF file is simply a repackaged version of a sfnt font with optional compression of the font data tables. The WOFF file format also allows font metadata and private-use data to be included separately from the font data. WOFF encoding tools convert an input sfnt font into a WOFF formatted file, and user agents restore the sfnt font data for use with a Web document.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The structure and contents of decoded font data exactly match those of a well-formed input font file. Tools producing WOFF files may provide other font editing features such as glyph subsetting, validation or font feature additions but these are considered outside the scope of this format. Independent of these features, both tools and user agents are expected to assure that the validity of the underlying font data is preserved.
                </p>

            <h4 id="general-requirements">General Requirements</h4>
                <p>
                    The primary purpose of the WOFF format is to package fonts linked to Web documents by means of CSS @font-face rules. User agents supporting the WOFF file format for linked fonts must respect the requirements of the CSS3 Fonts specification ([CSS3-Fonts] Section 4.1: The @font-face rule). In particular, such linked fonts are only available to the documents that reference them; they MUST NOT be made available to other applications or documents on the user's system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note <br>
                    The WOFF format is intended for use with @font-face to provide fonts linked to specific Web documents. Therefore, WOFF files must not be treated as an installable font format in desktop operating systems or similar environments. The WOFF-packaged data will typically be decoded to sfnt format for use by existing font-rendering APIs that expect OpenType font data, but such decoded font must not be exposed to other documents or applications.
                </p>

                <h4 id="overall-file-structure">Overall File Structure</h4>
                <p>
                    The structure of WOFF files is similar to the structure of sfnt fonts: a table directory containing lengths and offsets to individual font data tables, followed by the data tables themselves. The sfnt structure is described fully in the TrueType [TrueType], OpenType [OpenType] and Open Font Format [OFF] specifications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main body of the file consists of the same collection of font data tables as the input sfnt font, stored in the same order, except that each table MAY be compressed, and the sfnt table directory is replaced by the WOFF table directory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note <br>
                    The WOFF specification does not guarantee that the actual font data packaged in a valid WOFF container is in fact correct and usable. It requires only that the WOFF packaging structure header, table directory, and compressed tables conforms to this specification. The contained data must be used with just as much caution as font data delivered in "raw" form or via any other packaging method.
                </p>
                <a href="#wrapper">↑ Up</a>
            </div>
            <div class="parrafo04">
                <h4 id="woff-header">WOFF Header</h4>
                <p>
                    The header includes an identifying signature and indicates the specific kind of font data included in the file (TrueType or CFF outline data); it also has a font version number, offsets to additional data chunks, and the number of entries in the table directory that immediately follows the header
                </p>
                <p>
                    The signature field in the WOFF header MUST contain the "magic number" 0x774F4646. If the field does not contain this value, user agents MUST reject the file as invalid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The flavor field corresponds to the "sfnt version" field found at the beginning of an sfnt file, indicating the type of font data contained. Although only fonts of type 0x00010000 (the version number 1.0 as a 16.16 fixed-point value, indicating TrueType glyph data) and 0x4F54544F (the tag 'OTTO', indicating CFF glyph data) are widely supported at present, it is not an error in the WOFF file if the flavor field contains a different value, indicating a WOFF-packaged version of a different sfnt flavor. (The value 0x74727565 'true' has been used for some TrueType-flavored fonts on Mac OS, for example.) Whether client software will actually support other types of sfnt font data is outside the scope of the WOFF specification, which simply describes how the sfnt is repackaged for Web use.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    The WOFF majorVersion and minorVersion fields specify the version number for a given WOFF file, which can be based on the version number of the input font but is not required to be. These fields have no effect on font loading or usage behavior in user agents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The totalSfntSize field is the sum of the uncompressed font table sizes, each padded to a multiple of 4 bytes, plus the size of the sfnt header and table directory. Thus, this is the size of buffer needed to decode the complete WOFF-packaged font (but not metadata, which is not part of the input sfnt file) into a standard sfnt structure. This value MUST be a multiple of 4, because all font tables including the last are to be padded to a 4-byte boundary. If this value is incorrect, a conforming user agent MUST reject the file as invalid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The sfnt header includes three fields (searchRange, entrySelector and rangeShift) that are designed to facilitate a binary search of the table directory. As the proper value for each of these fields can be computed directly from the number of font tables, they are not stored in the WOFF file. User agents that decode WOFF files back to an sfnt structure MUST therefore compute the correct values for these fields in the sfnt header, as described in the OpenType/OFF specification.[OFF]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note <br>
                    The correct value for totalSfntSize may be computed as illustrated by the following pseudo-code
                </p>
                <p>
                    If either or both of the metadata or private blocks is not present, the relevant offset and length fields MUST be set to zero. If the metadata or private data offset and length fields indicate byte ranges that overlap other data blocks or tables, or extend beyond the end of the file, a conforming user agent MUST reject the file as invalid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The header includes a reserved field; this MUST be set to zero. If this field is non-zero, a conforming user agent MUST reject the file as invalid.
                </p>
                <a href="#wrapper">↑ Up</a>

            <div class="parrafo05">
                <h4 id="table-directory">Table Directory</h4>
                <p>
                    The table directory is an array of WOFF table directory entries, as defined below. The directory follows immediately after the WOFF file header; therefore, there is no explicit offset in the header pointing to this block. Its size is calculated by multiplying the numTables value in the WOFF header times the size of a single WOFF table directory. Each table directory entry specifies the size and location of a single font data table.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The format of tag values are defined by the specifications for sfnt fonts. The offset and compLength fields identify the location of the compressed font table. The origLength and origCheckSum fields are the length and checksum of the input font table from the table directory of the input font.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The sfnt format specifications require that font tables be aligned on 4-byte boundaries. Font tables whose length is not a multiple of 4 are padded with null bytes up to the next 4-byte boundary. Font data tables in the WOFF file have the same requirement: they MUST begin on 4-byte boundaries and be zero-padded to the next 4-byte boundary. The compLength and origLength fields in the table directory store the exact, unpadded length.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the offset and compLength values indicate a byte range that overlaps other data blocks or font tables, or if the byte range extends beyond the end of the file, a conforming user agent MUST reject the file as invalid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the length of a compressed font table would be the same as or greater than the length of the input font table, the font table MUST be stored uncompressed in the WOFF file and the compLength set equal to the origLength. Tools MAY also opt to leave other tables uncompressed (e.g. all tables less than a certain size), in which case compLength will be equal to origLength for these tables as well. WOFF files containing table directory entries for which compLength is greater than origLength are considered invalid and MUST NOT be loaded by user agents. Files containing compressed font tables that decompress to a size other than origLength are also considered invalid and MUST NOT be loaded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The result of creating a WOFF file and then decoding this to regenerate an sfnt font MUST result in a final font that is bitwise-identical to the well-formed input font.. If the input font has defects or anomalies that make this impossible, the WOFF-generating tool SHOULD either reject the font or issue an appropriate warning that lossless round-trip conversion will not be possible.
                </p>

            <div class="parrafo06">
                <h4 id="font-date-tables">Font Date Tables</h4>
                <p>
                    The font data tables in the WOFF file are exactly the same as the tables in the input font, except that each table MAY have been compressed. If compressed, it MUST have been compressed by the compress2() function of zlib [Compress2] (or an equivalent, compatible algorithm). User agents use the uncompress() function of zlib [Uncompress](or an equivalent, compatible algorithm) to decompress each table. The underlying format these functions use is described in the ZLIB specification [ZLib]. User agents or other programs that decode WOFF files MUST be able to handle tables that have been compressed. If the decompression function fails for any table, the WOFF file is invalid and MUST NOT be loaded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The font data tables MUST be stored immediately following the table directory, without gaps except for any padding that is required (up to three null bytes at the end of each table) to ensure 4-byte alignment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Font tables in WOFF files MUST be stored in the same order as the well-formed input font. The table order is implied by offset values in the table directory; sorting table directory entries into ascending offset value order produces a list of entries in an order equivalent to that of the font tables. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note <br>
                    User agents need not necessarily reconstitute the input font as a whole, and may reorder tables when decoding the WOFF file to sfnt form; they may access individual tables directly as needed. Under these circumstances the resulting sfnt will no longer be an exact copy of the input font, and checksums or digital signature data may be invalidated as a result.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In some cases, sites deploying WOFF files as Web fonts may wish to subset the character repertoire, optimize table ordering for efficient text layout or rasterization, or remove (or add) optional font tables depending on the particular features needed for a site. User agents might make similar modifications to the font during decoding, such as omitting tables that are not needed by their particular text display system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The automatic removal of OpenType features such as GPOS and GSUB information at any stage in the process of deploying a WOFF file is strongly discouraged. Many writing systems around the world rely on these features for very basic display of text in the script that they use.
                </p>
                <p>	
                    If either a WOFF-creation tool or a WOFF-consuming user agent reorders or otherwise modifies the collection of font tables, the font checksum in the head table will need to be recalculated as it will be affected by the changed offsets in the sfnt table directory. Any DSIG table in the input font will also be invalidated by such changes, and should therefore be removed from the modified font. A new signature could be added to the modified font, as described by the OpenType and Open Font Format specifications (if appropriate signing credentials are available to the tool involved). Any such pre- and/or post-processing represents a modification of the font data being packaged; while it might be done in conjunction with WOFF packaging for Web deployment, it falls outside the scope of the WOFF specification.

                <h4 id="extended-metadata-block">Extended Metadata Block</h4>
                <p>
                    The WOFF file MAY include a block of extended metadata. This may be more extensive and more easily accesible than metadata present in sfnt tables. The metadata block consists of XML data compressed by zlib; the file header specifies both the size of the actual compressed and the original uncompressed size in order to facilitate memory allocation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The presence (or absence) and content of the metadata block MUST NOT affect font loading or rendering behavior of user agents; it is intended to be purely informative. User agents MAY provide a means for users to view information about fonts (such as a "Font Information" panel). If such information is provided, then they MUST treat the metadata block as the primary source, and MAY fall back to presenting information from the font's name table entries when relevant extended metadata elements are not present.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If present, the metadata MUST be compressed; it is never stored in uncompressed form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The metadata block MUST follow immediately after the last font table. As all font data tables are padded with up to three null bytes if needed to reach a 4-byte boundary, the beginning of the metadata block will always be 4-byte aligned. If the metadata block is the last block in the WOFF file, there SHOULD be no additional padding after the end of the block.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The WOFF file MAY include a block of arbitrary data, allowing font creators to include whatever information they wish. The content of this data MUST NOT affect font usage or load behavior of user agents. User agents should make no assumptions about the content of a private block; it may (for example) contain ASCII or Unicode text, or some vendor-defined binary data, and it may be compressed or encrypted, but it has no publicly defined format. Conformant user agents will not assume anything about the structure of this data. Only the font developer or vendor responsible for the private block is expected to understand its contents.
